        If the graph is initially represented as a matrix, then the number of edges is calculated as the number of 1, 's 
        in the edgeMatrix. These 1, 's represent a connection between node i and node j, and since the graph is undirected
        the matrix is symmetric. This means that the edges are exactly double counted because if there is an edge 
        between node i and node j, then in the matrix there will be a 1,  in both the (i,j)'th and the (j,i)'th entry. 
        To compensate for the double counting, the number of 1, 's is then divided by 2. 
        In the case that the graph is represented by an edgeList, the number of edges is the number of pairs (i,j) in 
        the list divided by 2. This counts the edges because these ordered pairs also double count the edges since any 
        edge between node i and node j will (in the list representation of the graph) require that the tuple (i,j) be 
        appended to the list of neighbours of node i, and the tuple (j,i) be appended to the list of neighbours of node
        j. Therefore, this will also double-count the edges in the graph and this count should also be divided by 2.
